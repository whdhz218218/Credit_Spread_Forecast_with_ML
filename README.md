With economic, financial, and other data, I develop a forecast of the direction and the magnitude of credit spread of US investment grade 
corporate bonds (e.g. BofAML US Corporate AAA) over US Treasuries (e.g. 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate) movements using 
machine-learning based tools and techniques.
